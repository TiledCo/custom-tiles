# Tiled Custom Tile Studio

## Installation

### Pre-requisites

`npm install -g nodemon`
`npm install -g eslint`

### Install the node module requirements

`npm install`


## Running the Studio
1. Open 2 terminal windows / tabs
2. Run `npm start` in the 1st terminal tab
3. Run `npm run start-webpack` in the 2nd terminal tab (or `npm run start-webpack-dist` to compile minified versions)

## Creating a new custom tile
1. Kill running processes if needed.
2. Edit `tiles.json` and add a new entry with an `id`, `name`, and `shortName`. The `id` must be unique.
3. Create a new JavaScript file in `./src` with the same name as the `id` in `tiles.json`. (Feel free to duplicate an existing tile to get started).
4. Start the studio again.

## Submitting tiles
As you build and test your tiles locally, the tile bundle will be automatically generated by webpack. Once all of the desired functionality has been completed, simply send the bundle over to the Tiled team.

1. Run `npm run start-webpack-dist`
2. Check the `dist` directory for your new folder (matching the name of your tile)
3. Send the built directory under the `dist` directory to the Tiled team
