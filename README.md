# Tiled Custom Tile Studio

## Installation
TBD

### Pre-requisites

- `npm install -g nodemon`
- `npm install -g eslint`

### Install the node module requirements

`npm install`


## Running the Studio
1. Open 3 terminal windows / tabs
2. Run `npm start` in the 1st terminal tab
3. Run `npm run start-webpack` in the 2nd terminal tab (this automatically builds the development version of your custom tile)
1. Run `npm run start-webpack-dist` in the 3rd terminal tab (this automatically builds the compiled distributions)

## Creating a new custom tile
1. Kill any running processes if needed.
2. Edit `tiles.json` and add a new entry with an `id`, `name`, and `shortName`. The `id` must be unique.
3. Create a new JavaScript file in `./src` with the same name as the `id` in `tiles.json`. (Feel free to duplicate an existing tile to get started).
4. Start the studio again (see "Running the Studio").

## Submitting tiles
As you build and test your tiles locally, the tile bundle will be automatically generated by webpack. Once all of the desired functionality has been completed, simply send the bundle over to the Tiled team.

1. Check the `dist` directory for your new folder (matching the name of your tile)
2. Send the following items over to the Tiled development team by emailing us at dev@tiled.co:
- `tiles.json` (with your new tile additions)
- Raw custom tile source (`src/yourNewTile.js`)
- Built directory under the `dist` directory to the Tiled team (`dist/yourNewTile`)
